# BPplus-Reservoir
Reservoir analysis for BPplus files *bRes_bpp*.
Matlab scripts to read BPplus files (\*.xml) and perform reservoir analysis 
and estimate some other related hemodynamic parameters from blood pressure waveforms.
**This is a beta version and hasn't been subjected to extensive testing**

Method for wave intensity analysis is based on: Alun Hughes, Chloe Park, Anenta Ramakrishnan, Jamil Mayet, Nish Chaturvedi, Kim Parker
